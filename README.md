## Recommendations

* Visual Studio Code 1.0.0 or above

Although the extension should work on any version of Visual Studio Code, it hasn't been tested so it's recommended that you use a newer version of Visual Studio Code.

## Issues or Suggestions

Version 1.0.5 and version 1.0.6 should be updated immediatly. Both of these versions have quite a few bugs and we recommend using version 2.0.0 or above. If you wish to continue using the "old" Windows 11 Color Theme, download version 1.0.4 which is the most stable version of Windows 11 Color Theme v1.

If you encounter any issues while using this extension, or if you wish to suggest any new colours for the extension, [write them down on out GitHub Issues page](https://github.com/VSCodeExtensions/Windows-11-Color-Theme/issues).
